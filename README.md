# Plex Meta Manager Metadata Set Creator

Plex Meta Manager Metadata Set Creator is an open source Python 3 project that has been created to create a metadata file and associated set file for a list.

## Installing PMM Metadata Set Creator

Generally, PMM Metadata Set Creator can be installed in one of two ways:

1. Running on a system as a Python script [we will refer to this as a "local" install]
2. Running as a Docker container

GENERALLY SPEAKING, running as a Docker container is simpler, as you won't have to be concerned about installing Python, or support libraries, or any possible system conflicts generated by those actions.

For this reason, it's generally recommended that you install via Docker rather than directly on the host.

If you have some specific reason to avoid Docker, or you prefer running it as a Python script for some particular reason, then this general recommendation is not aimed at you.  It's aimed at someone who doesn't have an existing compelling reason to choose one over the other.

### Install Walkthroughs

There are no detailed walkthroguhs specifically for PMM Metadata Set Creator but the process is extremely similar to how you would do it with [Plex Meta Manager](https://metamanager.wiki/en/latest/home/installation.html#install-walkthroughs).

### Local Install Overview

PMM Metadata Set Creator is compatible with Python 3.11. Later versions may function but are untested.

These are high-level steps which assume the user has knowledge of python and pip, and the general ability to troubleshoot issues. 

1. Clone or [download and unzip](https://github.com/meisnate12/PMM-Metadata-Set-Creator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/meisnate12/PMM-Metadata-Set-Creator
```
2. Install dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. If the above command fails, run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt --ignore-installed
```

At this point PMM-Metadata-Set-Creator has been installed, and you can verify installation by running:

```shell
python metadata_set_creator.py
```

## Options

Each option can be applied in three ways:

1. Use the Shell Command when launching.
2. Setting the Environment Variable.
3. Adding the Environment Variables to `config/.env`
